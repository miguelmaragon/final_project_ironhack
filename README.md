### :raising_hand: **FREE FEE ATM** 

### :baby: **Status**
I have done this work as Ironhack Data Analytics Final Project

### :running: **One-liner**
I want to show on a map the location of those ATMs near your address and tell you what commission you will be charged, so you can find the nearest and cheapest ATM.

### :computer: **Technology stack**
- Programme language: Python
- 4 Google APIs such as Geocoding or Directions, among others
- Main libraries like pandas, googlemaps, requests, gmaps and pypeline.

### :boom: **Core technical concepts and inspiration**
ATMs are the main means of obtaining cash: 61% of the total. But there is a big problem, when we withdraw cash they charge us a fee if the ATM is not the one in our entity.

However, the law establishes that the entity that owns a cash dispenser cannot apply a commission to the consumer: only a charge to the bank that owns the plastic and this entity will pass on this commission to its client.

And an important fact, 40% of Spanish businesses do not accept payment by card.

The conclusion is quick, we still need to have cash in our pockets.
In the mobile applications of the 3 big Spanish banks, they show you where their offices are but... what if I showed you the nearest ATM and what commission it charges? That would be useful, right?

Enter an address, the banks of your cards and the means of transport, and you will get the routes to the ATMs.

### :see_no_evil: **Usage**
Possible use cases of the application:
- When you go with your friends to a rural house in an unknown town
- When you go shopping in an area you don't know and the store doesn't accept card payment.
- When you go to a sporting event or concert

### :shit: **ToDo**
